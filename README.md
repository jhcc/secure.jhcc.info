# secure.jhcc.info

This repository was created to preserve the code at secure.jhcc.info. That website was created by Ryan Quinlan using the Atfiliate platform (https://the.atfiliate.com/#/page/main)

I created a new directory in this repo before changing any of the Atfiliate js/html at secure.jhcc.info. The directory was named based on the view.

Basically, Atfiliate takes care of and hosts all the code on the page except for specific js/html. I belive we are using a free version of Atfiliate.
